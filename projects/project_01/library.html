                         Annette von Droste-Hülshoff<br>
                        (10 January, 1797 – 24 May 1848), was a 19th-century German poet, novelist, and composer of Classical music. She was also the author of the novella Die Judenbuche.<br>

                        In an article for the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia, Francis Joste wrote, "The fame of the poetess rests chiefly on her lyric poems, her pastorales, and her ballads. 
                        In the poetic representation of nature, few can equal her. The poetical works of Annette von Droste-Hülshoff are imperishable. What makes them so is their originality, 
                        the proof that they are the works of a genius. It is this too that gained for their author the well-earned title of 'Germany's greatest poetess.'"[4]

                        The methods he developed for staining tissue made it possible to distinguish between different types of blood cells, which led to the ability to diagnose numerous blood diseases.

                        Bettina von Arnim<br>
                        (the Countess of Arnim) (4 April 1785 – 20 January 1859),
                        born Elisabeth Catharina Ludovica Magdalena Brentano, was a German writer and novelist.<br>

                        Bettina (or Bettine) Brentano was a writer, publisher, composer, singer, visual artist, an illustrator, patron of young talent, and a social activist. She was the archetype of 
                        the Romantic era's zeitgeist and the crux of many creative relationships of canonical artistic figures. Best known for the company she kept, she numbered among her closest friends Goethe, 
                        Beethoven, Schleiermacher, and Pückler and tried to foster artistic agreement among them. Many leading composers of the time, including Felix and Fanny Mendelssohn,Robert and Clara Schumann,
                        Franz Liszt, Johanna Kinkel, and Johannes Brahms, admired her spirit and talents. As a composer, von Arnim's style was unconventional, molding and melding favorite folk melodies 
                        and historical themes with innovative harmonies, phrase lengths, and improvisations that became synonymous with the music of the era. She was closely related to the German writers 
                        Clemens Brentano and Achim von Arnim: the first was her brother, the second her husband. Her daughter Gisela von Arnim became a prominent writer as well. Her nephews, via her brother 
                        Christian, were Franz and Lujo Brentano.

                        who developed a refined brand of Baroque architecture, fusing Austrian, Bohemian, Italian, and French elements to design some of the most impressive buildings of the period,

                        The Würzburg Residence is considered one of the most beautiful and well proportioned palaces in Europe[1] and the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers is considered by some as
