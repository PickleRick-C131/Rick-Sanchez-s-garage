	<h3>YIELD</h3>
	<p>2 dozen 3-inch cookies</p>

	<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

		<ul><li>2 cups minus 2 tablespoons cake flour<br>
		<li>2/3 cups bread flour<br>
		<li>1/4 teaspoons baking soda<br>
		<li>1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
		<li>1/2 teaspoons coarse salt<br>
		<li>1/2 sticks unsalted butter<br>
		<li>1/4 cups light brown sugar<br>
		<li>cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar<br>
		<li>large eggs<br>
		<li>teaspoons natural vanilla extract<br>
		<li>cup dark chocolate chips<br>
		<li>cup milk chocolate chips<br>
		<li>teaspoon sea salt</ul>


	<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

		<ol><li>Sift cake flour, bread flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a medium bowl. Set aside.<br>

		<li>Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter, white sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl until very light, about 5 minutes.<br>

		<li>Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition.<br>

		<li>Beat in the vanilla.<br>

		<li>Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds.<br>

		<li>Drop chocolate chips in and incorporate them without breaking them.<br>

		<li>Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for 24 to 36 hours. Dough may be used in batches, and can be refrigerated for up to 72 hours.<br>

		<li>When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and scoop 1/3 cup mounds of dough (the size of golf balls) onto baking sheet, making sure to turn horizontally any chocolate pieces that are poking up for a more attractive cookie.<br>

		<li>Sprinkle lightly with sea salt and bake until golden brown but still soft, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer immediately to a wire rack.<br>

		<li>Repeat with remaining dough, or reserve dough, refrigerated, for baking remaining batches the next day.<br>

		<li>Eat warm, with a glass of milk.</ol>

	<h2>EXPERT TIPS</h2>

	<p>The secret to richer Chocolate Chip Cookies with a more sophisticated flavor is letting the dough rest for 24 to 36 hours before baking.</p>
